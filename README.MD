Run main.py

## Code speed tester
- Two text fields, copy and paste code into each one.
- Press run to test code

### Note:
code takes about 0.06 seconds to run without any values
So if your code is in that range then it is optimal.

## Code includes
- a class that consists of the UI.
- views that handle logic.
- multi threading.
- main file that handles the interactions between the UI and the code.

#### I am proud of this project and the code in it.
